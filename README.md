# Python-Programs
Write a Python program to find unique prime numbers from the given list of an array of n integers. Once you find unique prime numbers, divide them into equal groups of 3 with first element being smallest,second element being median element and third element being largest of all.  Please note that as soon as you take a number, that number would not be available for further processing.Also, note that for even series of numbers, the median value would be a number that may not be available in the list as it would be an average of two numbers.
For example, if you have – {5, 10, 25, 27, 13, 5, 7, 71, 11, 101, 12, 13,29,103}

Unique prime numbers – {5,7,11,13,29,71,101,103}

Group of 3 arrays – {5, 29,103}, {7,29,101}, {11,29,71}, {13,29,29}
